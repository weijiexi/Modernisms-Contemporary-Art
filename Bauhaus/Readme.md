### Analytical Drawing
Analytical drawing exercises gave students the opportunity to observe the interaction of points, lines, and planes in everyday objects. Far from simply training artists to faithfully copy still-life arrangements, Kandinsky insisted that the study of nature revealed the forces of abstraction: “Natural laws of composition do not reveal to the artist the possibility of superficial imitation (which he frequently sees as the main purpose of the laws of nature) but, rather, the possibility of contrasting these laws with those of art.”9

Kandinsky’s analytical drawing practice found a parallel in Itten’s analytical study of old master paintings in the Preliminary Course. In this exercise, students drew grids over reproductions of canonical works of art in order to allow the most detailed analysis of form and color in the smallest gradient. The ultimate goal for both Itten and Kandinsky was the synthesis of external (natural) and internal (artistic) laws in the art of pictorial composition.
