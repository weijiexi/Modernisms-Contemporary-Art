## Core Ideas Behind Rothko's Art
### Emotional Intensity
Rothko believed that painting could (and should) evoke deep emotions—like tragedy, ecstasy, and doom. He wanted you to feel something profound, almost sacred, in front of his work.

“I'm not an abstractionist... I’m interested only in expressing basic human emotions—tragedy, ecstasy, doom.” — Rothko

### Non-Narrative, Non-Symbolic
Rothko rejected symbolism, stories, and even titles. He stopped naming his paintings and gave them numbers or colors instead.

He didn’t want you to "figure out" the painting—he wanted you to experience it.

### Color as a Spiritual Force
His use of color wasn’t decorative—it was spiritual and psychological. The soft, glowing rectangles were meant to draw you in, to create a kind of meditative space.

The colors often seem to breathe, shimmer, or pulse—especially in person.

### Large Scale = Immersion
Rothko made his paintings huge, often taller than the viewer. He said he wanted people to stand close, so the color fields would engulf their peripheral vision—like being inside a quiet storm of feeling.
