## Principles of abstract art 
Abstract art requires artists to break free from traditional figurative expressions and break through the constraints of reality to convey emotions, ideas and concepts in a freer and more innovative way. 

Abstract art does not rely on images in the real world, but expresses emotions and ideas through elements such as shape, color, line and texture.
#### Visualize complex information and express it in an easy-to-understand way
#### Invisible things become perceptible graphics and interactive elements
- Real-world objects, concepts or emotions are transformed into non-figurative, visual forms

  That is, invisible things become perceptible graphics
    - Shape/color/time & motion/data & information visualization
- Abstraction is the generalization, simplification and transformation of reality
    - Removing specific forms: images are transformed into geometric lines and color blocks
    - Symbolization: symbols or shapes replace specific things in reality
    - Emotions and energy: colors, shapes, dynamic lines express inner emotions
    - Visual metaphor: visual images are used to metaphorically represent invisible concepts
- Balance between concrete and abstract
    - Simplified form - Concrete forms are gradually simplified into geometric shapes or curves, retaining key visual features
    - Structure and deconstruction - Real objects are processed geometrically or fragmented, retaining a certain structural logic,making them recognizable and artistically processed
    - Color and emotion - The form tends to be abstract, using familiar colors or light and dark contrasts,allowing the audience to establish a connection with the real world in the subconscious
    - Partial concrete & overall abstract - The overall tendency is abstract, and the local concrete elements provide clues for interpretation
    - Movement & dynamic change - In interaction or animation, dynamic gradient,let the concrete elements gradually transform into abstract forms
- ### Simplification
Abstract art often reduces forms to their essence. It removes details and focuses on the basic shapes, colors, or lines that represent a subject—or sometimes, no subject at all.

Think: distilling a landscape down to blocks of color or shapes.

- ### Expression of Emotion or Thought
Rather than trying to imitate the real world, abstract art conveys feelings, moods, or ideas. The artist’s internal world is more important than external accuracy.

Example: Color and brushstrokes might express joy, chaos, or sadness.

- ### Focus on Elements of Art
Abstract artists often explore the pure elements of visual language:

Line

Shape

Color

Texture

Space

Form

They become the subject themselves—not a tool to represent something else.

- ### Non-Representational Forms
Abstract art often avoids recognizable objects. Sometimes it’s partly representational (like Joan Mitchell or Kandinsky), but it’s never about realism.

The work might suggest nature, people, or architecture, but never directly show them.

- ### Composition and Balance
Even in chaotic or expressive styles, there’s an underlying concern with visual balance, movement, and harmony—just like in design.

Abstract artists consider how elements interact in space, guiding the viewer’s eye.

- ### Freedom and Intuition
There’s often a strong sense of personal freedom, intuition, and spontaneity in abstract art. Artists break rules intentionally or invent their own systems.

Many abstract works evolve during the making process, rather than being fully planned.

- ### Philosophical or Conceptual Depth
Some abstract artists are influenced by spirituality, philosophy, psychology, or even math and science. They use abstraction to go beyond the surface of things.

Example: Kandinsky believed colors and shapes could create a kind of visual music that touches the soul.
