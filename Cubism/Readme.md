# Cubism
Cubism is one of the most influential movements in modern art and design, founded in the early 20th century by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. It revolutionized visual language by breaking away from traditional perspective and representation.

Cubism deconstructs subjects into geometric shapes, reassembling them into fragmented, abstract compositions from multiple viewpoints at once. It’s not about realism—it’s about seeing differently.
### Core Characteristics of Cubism
- Multiple Perspectives: Objects are shown from several angles simultaneously.
- Geometric Fragmentation: Subjects are broken into cubes, cylinders, planes, or cones.
- Flattened Space: No single-point perspective; foreground and background intermix.
- Monochrome or Limited Color: Especially in early Analytical Cubism, earthy tones dominate.
- Collage and Texture: Later Synthetic Cubism used newspaper, wallpaper, and textures.
- Abstract but Still Figurative: Early Cubism often abstracted real objects (violins, faces, bottles).

### Types of Cubism
- #### Analytical Cubism (1907–1912)
  - Deconstruction of forms
  - Mostly monochrome (brown, grey, beige)
  - Focused on structure, not color

- #### Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919)
  - Reconstruction using collage and bright colors
  - Simplified shapes
  - Introduced found materials
